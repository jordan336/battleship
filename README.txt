TODO List
---------
* Q-Learning agent
* Improve this readme
* Ship.takeDamage() should not assume damage of 1, it should be based on the torpedo
* Command line options for main.py to change test parameters
* Move placeShips() logic out of Game
* More unit testing
* Agents should use State to get their list of torpedos, not Rules
* State should update torpedo lists when an Agent fires a torpedo
* Running the tests doesn't work unless ran from battleship/ directory
* Agent statistics
