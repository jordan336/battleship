TODO List
---------
* Improve Q-Learning agent
* Improve this readme
* More unit testing
* Grid needs to handle case where there is a hit at a position, but the ship still has hit points at that position.
  An Agent should still be allowed to fire at a hit position in this case, or maybe its always allowed?
* Scoring systems needs overhaul
* Implement a logging system?
